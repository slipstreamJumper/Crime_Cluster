# Crime Clustering

This project was meant create a data pipeline that accessed a free API, processed the data, and visualized it on a map layer. W

There are several methods for displaying point data on a map, however, this project is unique as it creates a grid overlay over a geographic area, then creates a 'density map' within that grid. It is an alternative to a traditional heatmap. 

The second part of the project takes the crime data from the API and uses multiple clustering techniques to generate centriods for crime activity to display as point icons on the map.
